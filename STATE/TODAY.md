# Today
- Bootstrapping RADAR documentation and operational guardrails.

# Risks
- No product code exists yet; downstream engineering timelines depend on clear specs and workflows.
- Confirmation policy needs strict adoption to avoid unsafe autonomous actions later.

# Blocked
- Awaiting future decisions on infrastructure and integration authentication flows.

# Decisions
- Adopt chat-first project posture with proactive pings and autonomous task extraction at MVP.
- Use local JSONL for MCP memory storage to retain privacy and auditability.

# Next Actions
- Finalize confirmation policy, workflow guides, and secrets inventory for the team.
- Prepare for future scaffolding (Next.js app, integrations) once documentation is approved.
