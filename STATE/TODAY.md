# Today
- Bootstrapping RADAR documentation and operational guardrails.

# Risks
- No product code exists yet; downstream engineering timelines depend on clear specs and workflows.
- Confirmation policy needs strict adoption to avoid unsafe autonomous actions later.

# Blocked
- Awaiting future decisions on infrastructure and integration authentication flows.

# Decisions
- Adopt chat-first project posture with proactive pings and autonomous task extraction at MVP.
- Use local JSONL for MCP memory storage to retain privacy and auditability.

# Next Actions
- Finalize confirmation policy, workflow guides, and secrets inventory for the team.
- Prepare for future scaffolding (Next.js app, integrations) once documentation is approved.

# What changed
- Added signal delivery policies to the spec and generated RADAR documentation commits.
- Initialized the repo, scaffolded the Next.js app, and added Google/Prisma integration stubs.
- Implemented chat-first UI routes, poller loop, and OpenAI-backed nudge API.
- Ran initial Prisma migration, generated the client, and seeded default settings.
- Added VIP settings UI/API, seeded first VIP, and refactored poller logging + single-cycle helper.
- Freed port 3000, forced dev server to bind there, and confirmed poller runs with stable logging.
- 2025-09-29: Smoke test (real mail) passed â€” threads=3, tasks=3.

# Next Actions
- Populate VIP settings or sample inbox content so poller can create threads/tasks for deeper validation.
- Expand automated tests and monitoring around polling backoff and task extraction heuristics.
- Harden the free-port helper to support cross-platform environments and integrate into onboarding docs.
- Capture screenshot of /tasks showing dev-seed task for design archive.
- Local Node upgraded to v22 (per Jason), dependencies rebuilt, environment consistent with .nvmrc.
