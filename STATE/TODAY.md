# Today
- Smoke test validated: threads=3, tasks=3, VIP processing working
- Confidence slider + VIP-only toggle shipped; poller obeys new controls
- MCP filesystem access configured for Claude Build Advisor workflow

# Risks
- None currently blocking MVP progress
- Need to maintain beginner-friendly development pace

# Blocked
- Nothing blocking immediate next steps

# Decisions
- Adopt chat-first project posture with proactive pings and autonomous task extraction at MVP
- Use local JSONL for MCP memory storage to retain privacy and auditability
- Prioritize confidence controls (#1) before expanding feature scope
- Follow docs/ROADMAP.md priority order with Smart VIP/Suppression as #2

# Next Actions
- Kick off #2 Basic VIP/Suppression Rules (email/domain/topic matchers)
- Add /api/health endpoint for deploy checks
- Prepare GitHub Actions CI workflow (Node 22, build + tsc)
