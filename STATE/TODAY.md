# Today (2025-10-06)

## Session Summary
**Settings UI Complete**: Implemented full 6-section settings interface with sidebar navigation (Account, Signal Rules, Behavior, Notifications, Appearance, Data & Privacy). Simplified Signal Rules to focus on rule management only. Applied consistent glassmorphic dark theme styling per DESIGN.md. Added back navigation to main chat.

**Status**: Settings UI functional. Signal Rules section maintains existing API integration. Other sections are UI-only and need backend wiring.

- Added back navigation button in sidebar to return to /chat
- Made settings full-width layout with 280px sidebar
- Fixed settings UI issues: removed redundant confidence slider from Signal Rules (autonomy slider remains in Behavior), restyled Signal Rules with shared design tokens, expanded settings view full-width, and added Back to Chat navigation.
- Simplified Signal Rules section to match design: removed VIP textarea, confidence slider, and signal-only toggle; retained only rule parser, CSV import, and rules table with clean dark styling.
- Fixed settings navigation: settings button in main layout now routes to `/settings`, and settings back button returns users to the root page.
- Replaced mock data with live Prisma-backed APIs: added `/api/tasks`, `/api/projects`, `/api/messages`, wired ChatInput to `/api/chat`, and updated the chat UI to fetch and display real database content.
- Signal Rules maintains all existing API functionality (parse, CSV import, delete)
- Fixed poller Gmail connection: added `scripts/reset-history.ts`, taught Gmail client to auto-fallback when `historyId` is stale, and updated poller to clear and refresh historyId automatically.
- Enhanced Signal Rules UI: added search input with live filtering and click-to-sort table headers (type, pattern, action, exception, notes) with direction indicators.
- Fixed duplicate `handleSort` naming: renamed rules table sorting handler to `handleRulesSort` while keeping CSV sorting intact.
- Fixed duplicate `sortIndicator` naming: renamed rules table indicator helper to `rulesSortIndicator` to avoid collisions with CSV modal logic.
- Cleaned up old tasks from suppressed senders (script added) and tightened task detection keywords to reduce false positives from automated emails.
- Added Radar tab to sidebar: surfaces VIP signal threads with sender info, timestamps, and a badge for signals that already have tasks.
- **Design Refinement Session**: Iterated on UI/UX patterns in Figma
  - Redesigned action message cards: unified brown bubble with gradient task card, connected by line
  - Added Back Burner collapsible section to task sidebar (collapsed by default)
  - Improved subchat sidebar hierarchy: condensed task info, hover-to-open collapsible sections
  - Designed snooze interaction: timeframe tiles connected to RADAR message
  - Established tag system (generic tags, not domain-specific "stores")
  - Positioned RADAR Suggestions above chat input (not in sidebar)
  - Fixed interaction patterns: all button confirmations come from RADAR, not user
  - Designed project subchat: robust sidebar with progress indicator, task breakdown by status, team info
  - Added "Catch me up" feature: contextual overview button in input area to help overcome decision paralysis
  - Changed RADAR message interactions: persistent action buttons (copy, retry, thumbs up/down) always visible below messages instead of hover-only
  - Explored glassmorphism design approach for potential application to UI containers and cards
- Updated WORKFLOW.md and PROJECT.md to require DESIGN.md references for all UI work.
- **Previous Milestones**: Main chat, subchat, settings pages designed; confidence slider, signal filtering, health endpoint complete

# Known Issues
- None.

# Risks
- None currently blocking MVP progress
- Need to maintain beginner-friendly development pace

# Blocked
- None currently.

# Decisions
- Adopt chat-first project posture with proactive pings and autonomous task extraction at MVP
- Use local JSONL for MCP memory storage to retain privacy and auditability
- Follow docs/ROADMAP.md priority order
- Maintain AI parser + CSV flow as canonical interface for rule management
- **Use Anthropic Claude API directly** for chat implementation (not Google Vertex AI)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 via direct API ($3/$15 per million tokens, standard rate limits)
- Use "signals" terminology to represent filtered email threads (VIP and suppression rules working together)
- **Merged confidence + autonomy into single "Autonomy Level" slider** (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)
- **Back Burner concept** replaces hard delete for tasks (40-day context preservation, collapsible section in sidebar)
- **Dark theme primary** with potential light mode in future
- **Figma Make for UI design**, then translate to Codex for implementation
- **Generic tag system** instead of domain-specific labels (enables broader use cases)
- **Hover-to-open collapsible sections** with click-to-pin functionality
- **Connected UI elements**: action cards and interactive buttons use connecting lines to show relationships

# Next Actions
- Create docs/DESIGN.md with design tokens from Figma (colors, spacing, typography)
- Begin Codex implementation starting with main chat interface
- Build out subchat system with animation patterns
- Implement settings page with all sections
- Then: error-handling/redaction improvements (#4 roadmap)

- **Action Messages System**:
  - ✅ Database schema migrated: Added MessageType enum (REGULAR/ACTION/CATCHUP), task/project relations, confidence/isRead/snoozedUntil fields
  - ✅ ActionMessage component created: /src/components/ActionMessage.tsx with embedded card support, confidence chip, snooze/back-burner controls
  - ✅ API endpoints created: /api/messages/[id]/read, /api/messages/[id]/snooze, /api/messages/[id]/back-burner, /api/messages/unread-actions, /api/messages/catchup
  - ✅ Poller integration: Creates ACTION messages when tasks detected, generates contextual text, supports multi-task batching
  - ✅ ChatMessage renders ActionMessage component with snooze/back-burner handlers
  - ✅ Catch-up system in page.tsx aggregates unread actions on load and marks originals as read
  - ✅ Data flow animation stub highlights task cards during message actions
  - ✅ Documentation sweep (PROJECT.md, CONTEXT.md, DESIGN.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE/TODAY.md)
- Implemented action messages system: schema (MessageType/task-project relations/confidence), ActionMessage component with embedded cards, API endpoints, poller integration, conversational snooze, catch-up system.
- Fixed action message structure: control bar hosts snooze/back-burner/reschedule buttons, embedded cards limit to complete/open, sidebar cards expose complete/back-burner/open controls. Snooze and complete endpoints hardened.
- Fixed all API routes: corrected Next.js 15 async params handling in complete, snooze, back-burner, reschedule, and read endpoints. All task/message actions now log and return success without errors.
- Redesigned action message layout: vertical control stack in left margin, numeric confidence chip, dim-to-vibrant icon hover states, timestamp above bubble, indented follow-up prompts, no connector line, and lighter shadows across message surfaces.
- Implemented fixed 80px height for all task cards with ellipsis truncation, centered the vertical control column alongside cards, increased follow-up indentation to 80px, and standardized 16px spacing around action message content.
- Implemented TaskCard variant system: sidebar (flexible height), action-message (80px fixed), completed (56px compact) contexts each use tailored sizing and layout to prevent button overlap.
- Implemented elegant completed task hover: DONE badge morphs into tomato "MARK AS INCOMPLETE?" CTA, arrow fades out, and title edge blurs under the badge for clarity.
- CURRENT ISSUE: Completed task card hover interaction partially implemented but MARK AS INCOMPLETE button positioning is broken. Button should be at far right edge of card, needs box-shadow glow instead of blur overlay, and two-step hover (card→tomato, button→indigo) not working. All other functionality working: variants system, API endpoints, basic hover state.

**Action Message Progress - Session End:**
- ✅ Action message controls repositioned to left margin of task cards
- ✅ Task cards increased to h-28 (112px) for better spacing
- ✅ Expandable snooze prompts: click snooze → prompt appears below card, select time → prompt closes
- ✅ Glowing snooze button: icon glows blue and pulses when snoozed, click shows countdown menu with cancel button
- ✅ Snooze API integration working: calls /api/messages/[id]/snooze, stores time in database
- ✅ Control button vertical spacing fixed: changed from centered grouping to evenly distributed across full card height
- ✅ Reschedule state management added (refs, menus, click-outside)
- ✅ Reschedule handlers wired, button toggles prompt/menu
- ✅ Reschedule feature matches snooze pattern (prompt, menu, API)
- ✅ Smooth expand/collapse animations (300ms CSS transitions)
- ✅ Chat auto-scrolls to bottom on initial load and new messages
- ✅ X buttons on expandable prompts only (not countdown menus)
- ⏳ INCOMPLETE: Smooth expand/collapse animations (currently instant)
- ⏳ INCOMPLETE: Completed task hover button positioning (MARK AS INCOMPLETE too far left)

Reduced poller interval to 30 seconds for testing (was 3 minutes)
Added debug logging to commitment detection to troubleshoot task creation
🐛 FIXED: Commitment detection now runs on BOTH direction emails (self-sent emails)
UI polish: Reduced spacing between action messages from 32px to 16px (mb-8 → mb-4) for tighter vertical layout
UI polish: Reduced chat container bottom padding from 64px to 16px (py-16 → pt-16 pb-4) to eliminate excessive empty space at bottom

## END OF SESSION - October 8, 2025

**CommitmentDock System Status:**
✅ WORKING: Dock displays uninteracted commitments (6 test cards showing)
✅ WORKING: Gmail labeling system (RADAR/Processed label created, 6 emails labeled)
✅ WORKING: Sidebar only shows tasks AFTER dock interaction (currently empty - correct!)
✅ WORKING: Radar tab shows VIP signal threads
✅ WORKING: OAuth re-authenticated with gmail.modify scope
✅ WORKING: Nuclear cleanup + fresh data from poller

**CURRENT BUG:**
❌ Complete button (checkmark on mini card) - card disappears from dock but task doesn't appear in Completed section of sidebar
- Expected: Click ✓ → card animates out → task appears in Completed
- Actual: Click ✓ → card animates out → task missing from sidebar
- Note: Checkmark is on mini card (default view), not in diamond controls (expanded view)

**TODO NEXT SESSION:**
1. Debug complete button - check /api/tasks/complete endpoint and sidebar refresh
2. Test reschedule action (calendar icon in diamond)
3. Test ignore action (eye-slash in diamond)
4. Test back burner action (flame in diamond)
5. Test snooze action (clock in diamond)
6. Verify all actions properly move tasks to correct sidebar sections

**Test Emails in Gmail (all labeled RADAR/Processed):**
- Send P&L to Josh by Friday
- Send budget to Tony by 3:15pm tomorrow (2 versions)
- Feed the dog this Friday (2 versions)
- Send meeting notes to Josh

**Clean Data State:**
- All test data deleted and recreated fresh
- No duplication issues
- Flow working: Email → Task + ACTION Message → Dock → (waiting for user action) → Sidebar

Fixed TaskCarousel auto-select on complete

Created backup/restore scripts for test data (backups/ directory)

Fixed sidebar to only show tasks after dock interaction - new commitments stay in dock until acted upon

Nuclear cleanup script + Gmail RADAR/Processed label system prevents re-processing

Updated Gmail OAuth scope from readonly to modify to enable label management
