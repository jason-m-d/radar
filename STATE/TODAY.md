# Today
- Smoke test validated: threads=3, tasks=3, VIP processing working
- Ready to implement confidence slider + VIP-only toggle for user control
- MCP filesystem access configured for Claude Build Advisor workflow

# Risks
- None currently blocking MVP progress
- Need to maintain beginner-friendly development pace

# Blocked
- Nothing blocking immediate next steps

# Decisions
- Adopt chat-first project posture with proactive pings and autonomous task extraction at MVP
- Use local JSONL for MCP memory storage to retain privacy and auditability
- Prioritize confidence controls (#1) before expanding feature scope
- Focus on ChatGPT's 10-item roadmap in priority order

# Next Actions
- Implement confidence slider (0-1) and VIP-only toggle in /settings
- Update poller to respect new confidence/VIP settings
- Test behavior changes with count-only logs

# What changed
- Added signal delivery policies to the spec and generated RADAR documentation commits
- Initialized the repo, scaffolded the Next.js app, and added Google/Prisma integration stubs
- Implemented chat-first UI routes, poller loop, and OpenAI-backed nudge API
- Ran initial Prisma migration, generated the client, and seeded default settings
- Added VIP settings UI/API, seeded first VIP, and refactored poller logging + single-cycle helper
- Freed port 3000, forced dev server to bind there, and confirmed poller runs with stable logging
- 2025-09-29: Smoke test (real mail) passed â€” threads=3, tasks=3
- Configured MCP filesystem for Claude Build Advisor access to live repo
