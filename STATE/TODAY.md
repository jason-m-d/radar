# Today
- Confidence slider completed and committed (roadmap #1 COMPLETE)
- Hybrid VIP/Suppression rules live: regex-first parsing, editable confirmation, AI fallback, previewable CSV import with overrides, poller logic
- Health check endpoint published for deploy monitoring

# Risks
- None currently blocking MVP progress
- Need to maintain beginner-friendly development pace

# Blocked
- Nothing blocking immediate next steps

# Decisions
- Adopt chat-first project posture with proactive pings and autonomous task extraction at MVP
- Use local JSONL for MCP memory storage to retain privacy and auditability
- Follow docs/ROADMAP.md priority order (now moving to #3 Health Check Endpoint)
- Maintain AI parser + CSV flow as canonical interface for rule management

# Next Actions
- Plan and implement error-handling/redaction improvements (#4 roadmap)
- Monitor rule telemetry, gather edge-case feedback for parser + exception tuning
- Prep deployment checklist updates now that health endpoint exists

# What changed
