## Current VIPs
- `woodydemayo@gmail.com`  
- `jason@hungry.llc`

## Features working
- Gmail poller (read-only scopes), cycles every 3 min.  
- Tasks auto-created from VIP mail with "tasky" phrases.  
- `/tasks` shows tasks (verified real email).  
- `/settings` allows VIP management and advanced rule controls.  
- **Confidence controls**: slider (0-1) and VIP-only toggle with real-time behavior changes
- **Hybrid VIP/Suppression rules**: regex-first parsing, editable confirmations, flexible CSV preview/override workflow, optional AI enrichment; poller applies rules + exceptions
- **Health endpoint**: `/api/health` exposes uptime, version, DB status for deploy checks
- Dev-seed harness working (`npm run dev-seed`).  
- Stable on **http://localhost:3000** with freeport script.

## In Progress
- **Error Handling & Redaction** (#4 priority)
  - Ensure logs redact sensitive data, user-facing errors stay safe
  - Status: Not started; queued next

---

## Rules & Guardrails
- Codex must treat Jason as a coding novice; no assumptions.  
- Always explain steps with [Terminal] / [Editor] / [Browser].  
- End every reply with "Next action for Jason" or "No action needed; ready for next step."  
- No secrets in logs.  
- Ask before schema migrations or file moves.  
- Auto-apply safe commands, batch them when possible.

## Development Priorities
See **docs/ROADMAP.md** for the full 11-item prioritized roadmap.  
Currently working on: #3 Health Check Endpoint
Next up: #4 Error Handling & Redaction
