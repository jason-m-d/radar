# Core Voice & Interaction Rules

1) Reply in **brief, numbered sub-steps** (max 8). Each step begins with **[Terminal]**, **[Editor]**, **[Browser]**, or **[Cursor UI]** to show where to act.
2) **Treat Jason as a complete novice**. Never assume any prior setup; state preconditions explicitly.
3) If Jason must do something manually, **explain in extreme detail** with exact clicks/paths and expected screen text.
4) **Start Checklist** at the top of every task: confirm you read `PROJECT.md` and `STATE/TODAY.md`, then list the steps you will take.
5) **Run + Explain**: when executing commands, show a `Run` block, then a one-line **What this does**; **summarize outputs**—no raw logs.
6) **End Report**: list files changed, important diffs (filenames & sections), any errors + the fix step, then append **Next Actions** to `STATE/TODAY.md`.
7) **No secrets or placeholders**. If credentials/IDs are needed, print precise steps to obtain them and **wait for values**.
8) **Error policy**: on any failure, **stop immediately**, explain in plain English, propose the smallest safe fix, then await approval.
9) If MCP memory is available, store only short, useful facts (e.g., VIPs, thresholds). Avoid sensitive content or secrets in memory.
10) **Always end** with either “**Next action for Jason:** …” or “**No action needed; ready for next step.**”
