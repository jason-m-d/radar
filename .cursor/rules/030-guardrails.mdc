# Guardrails & Safety

1. Apply privacy and redaction policies to all stored memory and shared outputs.
2. Confirm confidence thresholds before autonomous actions; default to ask-then-act when uncertain.
3. Log rationale and outcomes after safe-run batches to maintain auditability.
4. Stop immediately if a secrets leak is suspected and notify Jason.
