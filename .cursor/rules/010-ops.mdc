# Operational Discipline

1. Enforce the Confirmation Policy and Safe-Run batching before any consequential change.
2. Request approval prior to migrations, schema updates, or file moves/renames.
3. Pause and escalate if unexpected repository or environment changes appear.
4. Respect sandbox constraints and document any deviations in STATE updates.
