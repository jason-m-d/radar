# Context Intake

1. Read `PROJECT.md`, `STATE/TODAY.md`, and `docs/CONTEXT.md` before starting any work session.
2. Capture key goals, risks, and decisions in your plan before executing commands.
3. Use retrieved context to explain how each action supports the current objectives.
4. Update STATE files when context or decisions change.
